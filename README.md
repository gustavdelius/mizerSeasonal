# mizerSeasonal

Implementing seasonality in mizer

The first step is to implement the accumulation of gonadic mass throughout the year and its release during spawning periods. For the mathematical equations for this see <https://www.overleaf.com/read/npfwtrycjpxd#148d2d>. 

An initial version of the package is now functional. To build the documentation website for the package run
``` r
pkgdown::build_site()
```
Then take a look at the "Getting Started" page on that documentation website.

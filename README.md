Implementing seasonality in mizer

The first step is to implement the accumulation of gonadic mass throughout the year and its release during spawning periods. For the mathematical equations for this see <https://www.overleaf.com/read/npfwtrycjpxd#148d2d>. An initial version is now functional. See inst/experimentation.R for an example of how to use it.

## Deriving the PDE for gonadic mass

Standard mizer describes the number density $N(w,t)$ by the PDE
$$
\frac{\partial N}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial w}(g\,N)-\mu\,N,
$$ {#eq-PDEN}
where $g(w,t)$ is the growth rate of an individual of size $w$ and $\mu(w,t)$ is 
its death rate. This equation simply states that the rate of change of the number
of individuals in an infinitesimal size range around $w$ is given by the difference between the rate at 
which individuals grow into the size range and the rate at which they grow out (the transport term), 
minus the rate at which they die (the loss term).


Instead of the number density $N$ we could have used the biomass density $B = w\,N$ to describe
the population. Its evolution equation can easily be derived from @eq-PDEN
$$\begin{split}
\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} &= w\frac{\partial N}{\partial t}
= -w\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\left(g\,\frac{B}{w}\right)-\mu\,B,\\
&=-\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\left(g\,B\right)+g\,\frac{B}{w}-\mu\,B.
\end{split}$$
This is again intuitive: in addition to the transport term and the loss term we now also
have a source term $g B/w = gN$ representing coming from the growth taking place within the infinitesimal
size class. 

If we now denote by $\gbd(w,t)$ the total gonadic biomass density and by $\ggr(w,t)$ the gonadic
growth rate of an individual of size $w$ (when it is not reproducing), then they satisfy the analogous equation
$$
\frac{\partial \gbd}{\partial t} 
=-\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\left(g\,\gbd\right)+\ggr\,N-\mu\,\gbd-r\,\gbd,
$$
where we have an additional loss term representing the release of gonadic mass during reproduction.
The release rate $r(w,t)$ will encode the seasonality of this reproduction.

In mizer, the total energy $E_r$ available for growth an reproduction is split as $g=E_r(1-\psi)$ and
$\ggr=E_r\psi$. Thus $\ggr=g\,\psi/(1-\psi)$.

Instead of considering the total gonadic biomass density $\gbd(w,t)$, we could consider the gonadic
mass $\gw(w,t)$ of an individual fish of size $w$, given by 
$$
\gw = \frac{\gbd}{N}.
$$
Let's derive its evolution PDE:
$$\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \gw}{\partial t} &= \frac{1}{N}\frac{\partial \gbd}{\partial t}-
\frac{\gbd}{N^2}\frac{\partial N}{\partial t}\\
&=\frac{1}{N}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\left(g\,\gbd\right)+\ggr\,N-\mu\,\gbd-r\,\gbd\right)
-\frac{\gbd}{N^2}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial w}(g\,N)-\mu\,N\right).
\end{split}$$ {#eq-PDEwG}
To simplify this we observe that the two mortality terms cancel and that
$$\begin{split}
\frac{\gbd}{N^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial w}(g\,N)
&=\frac{\gw}{N}\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\left(g\,\frac{\gbd}{\gw}\right)\\
&=\frac{1}{N}\frac{\partial}{\partial w}\left(g\,\gbd\right)
-g\,\frac{\partial \gw}{\partial w}.
\end{split}$$ 
Substituting this into @eq-PDEwG and cancelling terms gives
$$
\frac{\partial \gw}{\partial t}=\ggr-g\,\frac{\partial \gw}{\partial w}-r\, \gw.
$$ {#eq-wg}
At this point we feel a bit stupid when we realise that
$$
\frac{d\gw(w,t)}{dt}=\frac{\partial \gw(w,t)}{\partial t}+
\frac{\partial \gw(w,t)}{\partial w}\frac{dw}{dt}
$$
and that $dw/dt = g$, so that @eq-wg reduces to
$$
\frac{d\gw}{dt}=\ggr-r\,\gw,
$$ {#eq-dqdt}
which is what we could have written down immediately, given our definition of $\ggr$.
So this equation would have been a good starting point for deriving the PDE @eq-wg.

All the above equations are species specific. So in particular there is one gonadic mass function
$q_i(w,t)$ for each species $i$ and we will need to specify one rate function $r_i(w,t)$ for each
species $i$.

\section{Reproduction rate}

We need to specify the mass-specific release rate $r(w,t)$. This then determines the total reproduction rate
\begin{equation}
R_p(t)=\frac{\epsilon}{2w_0}\int N(w,t)\gw(w,t)r(w,t)dw.
\end{equation}
It will be difficult to know how to choose the mass-specific rate $r(w,t)$ to produce the observed egg production rate $R_p(t)$. We'll probably have to do this by trial and error initially.
The rate $r(w,t)$ should become large at least once a year so that the gonadic
mass goes back to close to zero. 
One possibility would be to make $r(w,t)$ independent of $w$.

## Numerical implementation

To solve the PDE @eq-wg we use the same upwind-difference scheme used by mizer to solve the PDE @eq-PDEN. Let us therefore recall the details of that scheme.

We discretise @eq-PDEN as follows:
$$
    \frac{N_w^{t+1}-N_w^t}{\Delta t}=-\frac{g_w^tN_w^{t+1}-g_{w-1}^tN_{w-1}^{t+1}}{\Delta w}-\mu_w^t\,N_w^{t+1}.
$$ {#eq-nd}
Here we use $w$ and $t$ to denote the integer indices of the discretised weight and discretised time respectively.
Multiplying by $\Delta t$ and collecting terms gives
$$
    N_w^{t+1}\left(1+g_w^t\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta w}+\mu_w^t\,\Delta t\right)=
    N_{w-1}^{t+1}\left(g_{w-1}^t\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta w}\right)
    +N_w^t.
$$ {#eq-ndc}
Solving for $N_w^{t+1}$ gives
$$
    N_w^{t+1}=\frac{S_w^t-A_w^tN_{w-1}^{t+1}}{B_w^t},
$$ {#eq-nds}
where
$$
\begin{split}
   A_w^t&=-g_{w-1}^t\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta w},\\
   B_w^t&=1+g_w^t\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta w}+\mu^t_w\,\Delta t,\\
   S_w^t&=N_w^t.
\end{split}
$$ {#eq-ABS}
Given an initial value and a boundary condition encoding the influx of new-born individuals to the smallest size class, The recurrence relation @eq-nds allows mizer to calculate $N_w^{t+1}$ for all size classes at all later times.

Now we use the same scheme for the gonadic dynamics. So we discretise @eq-wg as follows:
$$
    \frac{\gw_w^{t+1}-\gw_w^t}{\Delta t}=-g_w^t\frac{\gw_w^{t+1}-\gw_{w-1}^{t+1}}{\Delta w}-r_w^t\,\gw_w^{t+1}+\ggr_w^t.
$$
Note how close this equation for $\gw$ is to equation @eq-nd for $N$.
Multiplying by $\Delta t$ and collecting terms gives
$$
    \gw_w^{t+1}\left(1+g_w^t\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta w}+r_w^t\,\Delta t\right)=
    \gw_{w-1}^{t+1}\left(g_w^t\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta w}\right)
    +\gw_w^t+\ggr_w^t\,\Delta t.
$$
Solving for $\gw_w^{t+1}$ gives
$$
    \gw_w^{t+1}=\frac{s_w^t-a_w^t\gw_{w-1}^{t+1}}{b_w^t},
$$ {#eq-qds}
where
$$
\begin{split}
   a_w^t&=-g_w^t\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta w},\\
   b_w^t&=1+g_w^t\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta w}+r_w^t\,\Delta t,\\
   s_w^t&=\gw_w^t+\ggr_w^t\,\Delta t.
\end{split}
$$ {#eq-abs}
Together with an initial value and the boundary condition that $\gw_1^t=0$ at all times because the smallest individuals do not yet have any gonadic mass, this recurrence relation allows us to calculate $\gw_w^{t+1}$ for all size classes at all later times.

Note how small the difference is between the discretised equation @eq-qds for $\gw$ and the equation @eq-nds for $N$. The only difference lies in replacing $A_w^t, B_w^t$ and $S_w^t$ given in @eq-ABS by $a_w^t, b_w^t$  and $s_w^t$ given in @eq-abs.

## Open problems

1. Once we are modelling cohorts in mizer, the diffusion terms in the size-spectrum dynamics will become important, because they will lead to the broadening of the cohorts. 

2. We do not yet know what the required step sizes are in size and in time to faithfully reproduce the dynamics. Too large size steps will lead to too much numerical diffusion. Too large time steps may lead to numerical instability.
